Brian Bornhorst
I'm interested in data science because I like analytics and I like helping people solve problems.
I don't have a strong programmingg background so I will be learning a lot as we progress through the course.
I took some statistics courses in my undergradute studies but haven't used that knowledge very much since then.  
In my current job we do some light statistics but I'm hoping to integrate more advanced statistics as I get comfortable.
I don't really have any considerable experience with R or Python, other than watching coworkers use it.
Hoping to learn the foundation, as the course is titled.  Tools, techniques, best practices.
I'm also hoping to learn from others experience and perspectives throughout this class and subsequent classes.  
Thank you.
